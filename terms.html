  <h1 class="text-center mb-4">Terms and Conditions</h1>


  <p>
    These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") set out the agreement between you ("the Author", "you") and Self Publish Books UK Ltd. ("the Company", "we", "us", "our"), a publishing service provider registered and operating in the United Kingdom. By engaging our services, you agree to abide by these Terms in full. These Terms comply with UK law and industry standards relevant to publishing, self-publishing, and associated digital services.
  </p>

  <h2>Definitions</h2>
  <h3>Author/Client</h3>
  <p>The individual or entity purchasing publishing services from the Company.</p>
  <h3>Work/Manuscript</h3>
  <p>The book, text, or content submitted by the Author for publishing.</p>
  <h3>Services</h3>
  <p>All services provided by the Company, including editing, design, formatting, marketing, distribution, and consultancy.</p>
  <h3>Contract</h3>
  <p>The agreement formed when the Author accepts these Terms and makes payment for any services.</p>
  <h3>Distribution Channels</h3>
  <p>Third-party retailers, platforms, and distributors, such as Amazon Kindle, Apple Books, Kobo, Google Play, Barnes &amp; Noble, and others.</p>
  <h3>Account Manager</h3>
  <p>The representative assigned by the Company to coordinate with the Author.</p>

  <h2>Scope of Services</h2>
  <p>
    The Company offers professional self-publishing solutions, including but not limited to manuscript editing, cover design, interior formatting, ISBN registration, marketing, distribution, and author support.
    The services selected by the Author will be set out in a written package or bespoke agreement.
    The Company acts as a service provider only. We are not a traditional publisher, and the Author retains full ownership and control of their work.
    The Company reserves the right to subcontract certain services (such as printing, distribution, or specialist design) to trusted third parties, while maintaining full accountability to the Author.
  </p>

  <h2>Author Responsibilities</h2>
  <h3>The Author Warrants</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>They are the sole owner of the Work or have secured all necessary rights and permissions to publish it.</li>
    <li>The Work does not infringe upon copyright, trademark, or any intellectual property rights of others.</li>
    <li>The Work does not contain defamatory, obscene, illegal, or otherwise unlawful content.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>The Author Agrees</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide the manuscript and all necessary materials in agreed formats.</li>
    <li>Respond promptly to communications from the Company.</li>
    <li>Review and approve proofs, drafts, and designs within specified timeframes.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>The Author Indemnifies</h3>
  <p>The Company against all claims, liabilities, and legal actions arising from breaches of warranties.</p>

  <h2>Payments, Fees, and Refunds</h2>
  <p>
    Fees for services are outlined in the package descriptions or bespoke service agreement.
    Payment is required upfront unless otherwise agreed in writing.
    The Company offers a 7-day money-back guarantee on standard packages if no significant work has begun. Beyond this, refunds will not be issued once services (such as editing, formatting, or ISBN registration) have commenced.
    All payments must be made in GBP (£) via approved payment methods.
    Prices include VAT where applicable.
  </p>

  <h2>Intellectual Property and Rights</h2>
  <p>
    Copyright in the Author’s Work remains with the Author at all times.
    The Company does not claim publishing rights, ownership, or royalties in relation to the Author’s Work.
    The Company may use the Author’s book title, cover, and brief excerpts in marketing materials and case studies unless expressly forbidden in writing by the Author.
    If the Author opts for an ISBN provided by the Company, it will be registered under Self Publish Books UK Ltd. If the Author provides their own ISBN, all responsibility remains with the Author.
  </p>

  <h2>Editing and Design</h2>
  <p>
    Editing services are designed to improve grammar, readability, and consistency. The Author is ultimately responsible for final approval of content.
    Cover and interior designs are created according to the Author’s brief and industry standards. The Author is entitled to revisions as per the package purchased.
    The Company will ensure designs meet the technical requirements of major distributors but cannot guarantee sales performance.
  </p>

  <h2>Formatting and Technical Services</h2>
  <p>
    The Company provides professional formatting for print and digital editions.
    Digital Formatting Services include EPUB formatting, MOBI conversion, and accessibility compliance where applicable.
    The Company ensures compatibility with major platforms but cannot be held responsible for subsequent platform changes outside of its control.
    The Author may request technical assistance for updates post-publication, subject to additional fees.
  </p>

  <h2>Distribution and Marketing</h2>
  <p>
    The Company coordinates distribution through selected third-party platforms (Amazon, Apple Books, Kobo, Google Play, Barnes &amp; Noble, etc.).
    The Author understands that distribution timelines and availability are subject to the policies of these platforms.
    The Company provides eBook distribution and print-on-demand setup but does not guarantee placement in physical bookshops unless explicitly included in the package.
    Marketing services are provided according to package specifications. The Company does not guarantee specific sales figures or reviews.
  </p>

  <h2>Royalties and Author Earnings</h2>
  <p>
    The Author retains 100% of royalties earned from sales through third-party platforms (after platform commissions and transaction fees).
    Where the Company collects payments on behalf of the Author, royalties will be disbursed quarterly, with full accounting provided.
    The Company does not deduct commission unless explicitly stated in a bespoke agreement.
  </p>

  <h2>Liability and Indemnity</h2>
  <h3>The Company Shall Not Be Liable For</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Loss of profits, sales, or anticipated earnings.</li>
    <li>Distribution delays caused by third-party platforms.</li>
    <li>Technical faults beyond its control (server downtime, platform errors, etc.).</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>The Company’s Total Liability</h3>
  <p>Shall not exceed the amount paid by the Author for services rendered.</p>
  <h3>The Author Indemnifies</h3>
  <p>The Company against any legal claims relating to the content of the Work.</p>

  <h2>Termination and Cancellation</h2>
  <p>
    Either party may terminate this agreement with 14 days’ written notice.
    If services have already commenced, refunds will not be available except under the money-back guarantee clause (see Payments, Fees, and Refunds).
    The Company reserves the right to cancel services if the Author breaches these Terms, in which case no refunds shall be provided.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Protection and Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The Company complies with the UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018.
    The Author’s data will be used only for the fulfilment of publishing services and will not be sold to third parties.
    The Author has the right to request data access, correction, or deletion at any time.
  </p>

  <h2>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
  <p>
    These Terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales.
    Any disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.
  </p>

  <h2>Amendments</h2>
  <p>
    The Company may update these Terms from time to time. The latest version will always be available on our website.
